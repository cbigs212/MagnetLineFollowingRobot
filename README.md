# MagnetLineFollowingRobot
Completed in Winter 2023, this robot is being programmed to mark with a sharpie where it detects a magnet. It works by following lines using infrared line following sensors. It will make a sound with a piezo buzzer as it detects a magnet, and it will return the strength of the field on an lcd screen, and flash a red or blue LED depending on the direction of the magnetic field (North / South). It is able to detect magnetic fields using the hall effect sensor.
